//react rendering 
//A re-render means that
1. React did some work to calculate what all should update in this component
2. The component actually got called (you can put a log to confirm this)
3. The inspector shows you a bounding box around the component
It happens when
1. A state variable that is being used inside a component changes
2. A parent component re-render triggers all children re-rendering
You want to minimise the number of re-renders to make a highly optimal react app
The more the components that are getting re-rendered, the worse
