#dom problems

What if there is a server where these todos are put
What if you update a TODO from your mobile app
You will get back the new array of TODOs on the frontend
How Wi" you update the DOM then?
You only have a addTodo function
You don't have an updateT0d0 or removeTod0 function yet

// lets try to create a todo application using DOM manipulation
/dumb solution 
clear the parent element 
call addTodo on every element 

//Better solution 

Don't clear the DOM upfront. update it based on what has
Question is, how does it aâ€¢lcaato what hao clungedl
Hao a todo been marked ae complete?
Has a todo been remcwd from the backend?

by remembering the odld todos in a variable (virtual dom )
and then updating the dom based on the difference between the old and new todos


What is the easiest way to create a dynamic frontend website?
Update a state variable  //frontend dev
Delegate the task of figuring out diff to a hefty function  // react
3. Tell the hefty function how to add, update and remove elements  //Frontend dev
